Question: as shareholders, do we get a say/vote at the BO price negotiations?

For example, i&#39;d take no less than 15B ($105/sh) for an &quot;all stock deal&quot; merger.

If they want to buy the company, they can pay up NOW for the HUGE FUTURE, and deals ahead, if MVIS would continue independently developing and manufacturing. 

So if they just want the IP, to manufacture &quot;their own&quot; tech (like $MSFT building the hololens 2 with $MVIS chip) then they can pay in advance, for the future royalties (in the billions) of selling &quot;their own tech&quot;  (army buying ~40K units, at ~20K per unit is already 8 BILLION gross)
call it &quot;a type of consignation&quot; 

AMZN started as  book store. 
FB started as a &quot;hot or not&quot; college thing 
GOOGL started as a search engine
TSLA started as... Paypal (well, its the same guy. Evolution)

This week, we can see that Bearish price action are being revealed one by one in the stock market. Even though I couldn&#39;t get a bearish confirmation on Friday trading and still remain Neutral on stock market, overall the bearish tide seems to be taking over pretty soon. 

Furthermore, as per the Tide Indicators for today (13 June 2020), we can see the fund flow on JPY had finally reversed to Short on the stock market. This further confirmed to me that a market peak/reversal is imminent. The price action on monday trading or next week will be important for myself regarding my remaining Long positions and trading plan.

I am looking forward to the upcoming Bearish tide and more will be shared in the full Tide Indicators analysis which will be posted in my blog on 15 June 2020. 😊",None,INTC

This week, we can see that Bearish price action are being revealed one by one in the stock market. Even though I couldn&#39;t get a bearish confirmation on Friday trading and still remain Neutral on stock market, overall the bearish tide seems to be taking over pretty soon. 

Furthermore, as per the Tide Indicators for today (13 June 2020), we can see the fund flow on JPY had finally reversed to Short on the stock market. This further confirmed to me that a market peak/reversal is imminent. The price action on monday trading or next week will be important for myself regarding my remaining Long positions and trading plan.
